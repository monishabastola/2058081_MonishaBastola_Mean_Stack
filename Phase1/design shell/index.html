                    A proposal to integrate and maintain the check in system to get a payroll for the employee at Thirty-one gifts Inc. In the current situation of covid-19 pandemic, we need warehouse worker to provide the production and due to the finger print system on warehouse for check-in is very risky and time consuming. <br>
                </b>
            
                <br>Technology has made the world closer and easier to access each and every aspect of work. Technology itself have a power to control each and every system in world to provide a safe place. As I have been watching and analyzing the clock in and out system at warehouse very closely. Â I have noticed that we have very few reaches to our potential customers and the production process is slower than the competitors. We need to make a process to reach out to the customer and mostly we need to work for customer to meet their requirement. In order to prevent from the consumer retention and the new costumer, we need to process our production quickly to our customer and in order to do that we can save time by generating EPAY login system to the warehouse employee too save time and prevent from covid-19 pandemic. This proposal is to convince the thirty-one gift Inc. to make the Epay login system to save the time and make the work easier and process the production quickly to our customer.
                FedEx warehouse has been using EPAY login system from January 2020 to prevent from COVID19 pandemic and also to save time to run the production. Because, I have seen it while we using clock in and out system at warehouse, we spend about 20/30 minutes. On that 20/30 minutes, we can check quality control of 8 cellphones and we can pass it into the shipping department. There is about 400 to 500 peoples work in one shift warehouse. Now we can imagine, how many cellphones we can pass it on to the shipping department by using the epay login system to save 20 to 30 minutes every day at work. Our competitor FedEx is already using this technology to make the work easier and it has been saving time of time. We implanted technology to the business world to save time and make it safe place for our worker.  FedEx expected to make about 4 billons by 2024. We as thirty-one gift Inc. is behind because we are not saving time. we have to understand the fact is time is money. Imagine, how many customizer bags we can have shipped it just saving 30 minutes every day at work.
	            I would like to present this proposal to the Cindy Monroe the co-founder of thirty-one gift Inc. to bring the Epay system to the warehouse because we can make lot of production by saving 20 to 30 min every day and this technology can implement warehouse in a different way. I hope you will consider my proposal and move forward with the final project.
